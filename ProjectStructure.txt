ðŸ“‹ Present Issues/Incomplete Areas
Room Entity, DAO, Repository, and UseCase Consistency

Are all the fields in FileIndex (incl. lastAttemptedAt, errorMessage) present in both code and schema?

Did you handle database migrations?

ProGuard minification rules

Syntax errors must be fixed for Retrofit/Gson/Room as described.

Color/Resource Definition

Color "primary_dark" and other _dark variants need to be defined in both values-night and base values to avoid runtime errors.

BackupStats Construction

All fields used in UI and code (errorCount, failedFiles) must be properly initialized and provided everywhere BackupStats is created.

Dependency Injection

Dagger/Hilt modules must provide the new or changed use cases and repositories.
