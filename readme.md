- **core/data/repository/FileRepositoryImpl.kt**: Implements business/data access logic.
- **core/domain/repository/FileRepository.kt**: Clean architecture interface for file stats, backup error, and failure queries.
- **core/domain/model/BackupStats.kt**: All backup statistics fields surfaced for UI/backend.

## üö© TODOs and Incomplete Items

- [ ] **Room entity migrations** for new fields (`lastAttemptedAt`, `errorMessage`).
- [ ] **Unit and DAO tests** for error/failed backup queries.
- [ ] **Consistency check of `BackupStats`** model‚Äîensure all usages include all parameters.
- [ ] **Hilt modules**: Provide all new/updated dependencies.
- [ ] **ProGuard rules**: Fix bad rules for Retrofit + Gson to avoid shrink/obfuscation crashes.
- [ ] **Resources**: Mirror all `_dark` color resources in `values/colors.xml` (not just `values-night`).
- [ ] **Code Cleanliness**: Remove deprecated/unused interface methods.
- [ ] **Docs**: Add KDoc/comments to complex queries and models.
